        <h1>Fa&ccedil;ade Pattern</h1>
        <hr />

<p>A real life application is never implemented as a monolithic block. That is a sure way to disaster. The application should be divided into multiple subsystems that interact with each other according to a defined protocol. This makes things more manageable and extensible - so that a change in one component does not impact the others. If we can achieve such isolation, we can guess that we are on the right track. </p><p>Just having multiple subsystems is not enough. The subsystems should be separate in spirit - not just in code - else an isolation is impossible. If the subsystems are truly independent, then the implementation of one has no relation with that of the other - so long as they follow the agreed interface. </p><p>In object oriented design, such a protocol is often implemented in form of a fa&ccedil;ade class. The fa&ccedil;ade class receives method calls from the rest of the application and passes them to the appropriate code within the subsystem - that is isolated from the application.</p><p>There is an important point we must remember when working with a fa&ccedil;ade class. Ideally the fa&ccedil;ade class should just pass on requests to the appropriate code within the module. But, at times developers tend to use it as a "shock absorber" - that just absorbs any changes that are required. This bloats the fa&ccedil;ade class and then damages the design pattern - reducing the maintainability. The fa&ccedil;ade class should remain a fa&ccedil;ade and nothing more than that.</p><p>Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. For example, consider a compiler that has many components hidden behind a simple interface.</p><h3>Participants</h3><hr/><p>There are two participants in this pattern:</p><ul><li>Fa&ccedil;ade - Knows which subsystem classes are responsible for a request. Delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem objects. </li><li>Subsystem classes  - Implement subsystem functionality. Handle work assigned by the Fa&ccedil;ade object. Have no knowledge of the fa&ccedil;ade; that is, they keep no references to it.</li></ul>

        <h1>Useful Resources</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>The internet is flooded with interesting resoruces for learning anything that we wantto learn. Here are some
            of my favorite ones.</p>
        <h2>Videos</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>Most of us professionals have very little time and stamina to read through books. We would always prefer to
            go through some videos and learn the subject quickly. Here are some of the online courses that I found
            useful.</p>
        <p>We have many sources of online video tutorials. Coursera, Udacity, edX, Udemy, Edureka are the most popular.
            Each of them have good set of tutorials on most subjects that one could think of. But when it comes to
            machine learning, nobody can beat Coursera, that is headed by Andrew Ng himself.</p>

        <h2>Github Repositories</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>Github is the home of creativity. Techies from all over the world have deposited their creations into this
            ocean of code. If one can search for it, almost all problems that we face already have a solution on
            Github. Here are some of the repositories on Github that I found useful. This list will continue to grow as
            I find more and more of these.</p>

The objectives of the Phase A include, defining a high-level architecture vision of capabilities and business values - that will be delivered by the proposed Enterprise Architecture.</p><p>This phase is also responsible for obtaining an approved Statement Of Work. The SOW defines a program of works to develop and deploy the architecture outlined in this Architecture vision.</p><h2>Inputs</h2><hr/><p>Any phase in the TOGAF ADM takes inputs from the previous phases and some external inputs, to generate defined outputs. The inputs to the Architecture vision phase can be classified into three parts:</p><h4>External References</h4><hr/><p>The TOGAF standard and any other framework in play provides the most important input to all the phases of the ADM. Along with this, the Architectural Reference Models from the repository and other external sources provide an input to the Architecture Vision phase.</p><h4>Non Architecture Inputs</h4><hr/><p>The Request for Architecture Work defined in the previous (Preliminary) phase forms an important input to the Phase A of the ADM. Along with this, the business principles, goals and directives provide an input to define the direction in which the business is heading. </p><p>These form an important input to defineing the Architecture Vision along with the SOW.</p><h4>Architectural Inputs</h4><hr/><p>Naturally, these are most important and direct inputs from the Preliminary phase and other phases in the ADM iterations. This includes the Organization Model, Tailored Architecture Framework and the Architecture Repository of the Continuum - containing the existing architectural documentation including the formal description of the intended and baseline architectures along with the various ABB's.</p><p>The Organization Model for the Enterprise Architecture is defined in the Preliminary phase and contains the various aspects including</p><ul><li>Scope of organizations impacted</li><li>Maturity assessment, gaps, and resolution approach</li><li>Roles and responsibilities for architecture team(s)</li><li>Constraints on architecture work</li><li>Re-use requirements</li><li>Budget requirements</li><li>Requests for change</li><li>Governance and support strategy</li></ul><p>The architecture framework tailored in the Preliminary phase contains</p><ul><li>Tailored architecture method</li><li>Tailored architecture content (deliverables and artifacts)</li><li>Architecture Principles, including business principles</li><li>Configured and deployed tools</li></ul><p>All these together are used by the Architecture Vision Phase to generate a high-level architecture vision of capabilities and business values, along with the statement of work approved by the stakeholders.</p><h2>Steps</h2><hr/><p>The ADM defines a generic set of steps for the Phase A of Architecture Vision. The level of detail that goes into the phase depends upon the the iteration level. Further down the iteration cycles, higher is the details. Similarly, the subset or the order of steps that we follow depend upon the nature of adaptation for the ADM defined in the Preliminary phase - based on the Architecture Governance.</p><p>The individual steps defined by the ADM are as follows:</p><h4>Architecture Project</h4><hr/><p>The entire enterprise architecture is a Business Capability; and each iteration of the ADM cycle is a Project. The architecture could be a standalone project, or it could be a part of a larger project. In either case, it should be planned and managed using the standard project management framework defined by the enterprise.</p><p>In this step, we need  to  include references to other management frameworks in use within the enterprise, explaining how this project relates to those frameworks. We need to conduct the necessary procedures to secure recognition of the project, endorsement of corporate management, and support/commitment of the necessary line management.</p><h4>Stakeholders, Concerns and Business Requirements</h4><hr/><p>The second step is to identify the stakeholders, their concerns and business requirements out of the enterprise architecture. The preliminary phase also touches the stakeholders. But that was with respect to identifying the stakeholders and a sponsor who could deal with them. </p><p>Here, we look at the actual stake of the stakeholders and their individual concerns.Here, we identify the components of the Architecture Vision for each stakeholder and their individual scopes; along with an understanding of factors that shape how the architecture is presented to each of them.</p><p>We generate a stakeholder map that is used identify these details - that also form an input to the Statement of Architecture Work and the Communication Plan</p><p>The stakeholder map also helps us identify the key roles and responsibilities. Again, there is a difference from the roles and responsibilities defined in the Preliminary Phase. The Preliminary Phase defines roles and their responsibilities with respect to to the different components of the enterprise architecture. Here, we define them with a more practical perspective of individual stakeholders and their concerns and communication plans.</p><p>The Architecture Vision phase typically generates more  requirements that could provide inputs to future architecture work, or even outside the scope of the enterprise. These are pushed into the Requirements Repository, to be managed by the Requirements Management Process.</p><h4>Business Goals, Drivers and Constraints</h4><hr/><p>Ensure that the business goals, business drivers and business constraints are properly documented, understood and incorporated in the Statement Of Architecture Work. The enterprise wide constraints based on the Architectural Principles and organization wide business principles were identified in the Preliminary phase. Here, we work for identifying the project specific constraints based on the corresponding business goals, drivers and constraints.</p><h4>Capability</h4><hr/><p>Architecture capability manifests in two forms - the ability of the enterprise to develop and consume an architecture, and also the baseline architecture of the enterprise. By comparing  these with the required architecture, we can identify the gap in the target and the current - and its feasibility. The Capability step is completed iteratively with the Preliminary phase.</p><p>The detailed capability study - of the required business and architecture - belongs  to the Phase B. But, here, the architect works on checking the capability of the enterprise to develop an architecture itself. Only if the enterprise is capable of developing an architecture, we can go ahead and evaluate the capability of the current and required architecture. Here we look for skills and ability to navigate through the ADM. </p><h4>Readiness for Business Transformation</h4><hr/><p>Similar to the previous step, here we evaluate if the enterprise is ready and capable of going through a business transformation. This assessment is based upon the determination and analysis/rating of a series of readiness factors. The results of the readiness assessment should be added to the Capability Assessment. These results are then used to shape the scope of the architecture, to identify activities required within the architecture project, and to identify risk areas to be addressed.</p><h4>Define Scope</h4><hr/><p>This step is repeated in the Preliminary Phase as well as the Phase A - with a difference. The preliminary phase scope stops at identifying what part of the enterprise would be affected. In phase A, we go a further, to define the scope of the enterprise architecture effort</p><ul><li>Breadth and Depth of the baseline and target architectures. Typically the baseline architecture is shallower compared to the target.</li><li>The domains (business, data, application and technology) covered and the time period aimed.</li><li>The details of the architecture partitioning required, the number and extent of any intermediate steps, etc.</li><li>Details of existing (internal or external) Architectural assets from the repository and continuum, or from the previous ADM cycles that will be leveraged</li></ul><h4>Confirm Architecture &amp; Business Principles</h4><hr/><p>The business and architecture principles are important guiding forces at every step of the ADM. The Preliminary phase takes care of incorporating them from the various sources or defining them if not available. The Phase A takes care of ensuring and confirming their validity with endorsement from the Architecture Governance and Corporate Management.</p><h4>Develop Architecture Vision</h4><hr/><p>After all the preparatory steps, we come to the main step of the Architecture Vision phase - developing the architecture vision.</p><p>This phase captures the policy development and strategic decisions - like rationalization decisions and metrics, revenue generation, and targets. These enable the subsequent work to be quantified. We also address other areas like Digital Transformation and IT strategy. These decisions will provide direction for the subsequent phases.</p><p>We start with an overall architecture, showing how the various architecture domain deliverables will fit together. We create a high-level view of the Baseline and Target Architectures based on the requirements, scope, constraints. The Architecture Vision covers the breadth of scope, at a high level. </p><p>This is often based on informal techniques - like sketching a simple diagram that shows major components and their interaction. Business scenarios may be used articulate the vision with respect to the business requirements. (TOGAF® Series Guide: Business Scenarios)</p><p>This generates a first top level view of the baseline and target architectures - that should be added to the Architecture  Repository.</p><h4>Target Architecture Value Propositions and KPI's</h4><hr/><p>With the architecture vision artefact in place, we should move on to creating a value proposition for the new architecture. The preliminary phase picked the top level business proposal, but the Phase A comes up with a concrete value proposition that includes</p><ul><li>Business case for the proposed architectures and changes</li><li>Value proposition for each of the stakeholder groupings</li><li>Procurement requirements</li><li>Performance metrics and measures for the Enterprise Architecture to define the business needs</li><li>Risk Assessment</li></ul><p>This value proposition is reviewed and agreed with the sponsors and stakeholders concerned. The outcomes of this step are included in the Statement of Architecture Work; as it allows performance tracking and evaluation.</p><h4>Risk Mitigation</h4><hr/><p>Here, we analyse the business risks in severity (catastrophic, critical, marginal, or negligible) and probability, and identify any mitigation plans.</p><p>Two main levels of risk are considered here:</p><ul><li>Initial Risk Level: Categorization prior to determining and implementing the mitigation actions</li><li>Residual Risk Level: Categorization after implementing the mitigation actions (if any)</li></ul><p>The risk mitigation should be part of the Statement of Architecture Work</p><h4>Statement of Architecture Work</h4><hr/><p>Finally, we move on to developing a statement of architecture work that will be used in the following phases.</p><ul><li>Identify the work products that need to be created or change and define the specific performance requirements, time lines, domains and level of detail for the architecture views, for the entire ADM cycle</li><li>For the work products that change, identify the level of change and the direction, the impact of this change on other existing work products</li><li>Resource requirement, availability and timescale for the resources. Based on this, prepare a roadmap of the scheduled activities</li><li>Communication plan among the architects and with the stakeholders, affinity groups and communities about the progress of the enterprise architecture</li></ul><p>These should be formally reviewed and approved with the stakeholders and signed off by the sponsor.</p><h2>Outputs</h2><hr/><p>The outputs of the Architecture Vision phase could include</p><ul><li>Statement of Architecture Work that includes project description and scope, overview of the vision and project plan and schedule</li><li>Refined statement of business principles, goals, drivers; along with the architecture principles</li><li>Capability Assessment</li><li>Tailored Architecture Framework continued from the Preliminary phase</li><li>Architecture Vision that defines the problem description, objective of the statement of architecture work, summary views, business scenarios and refined key stakeholder requirements</li><li>Draft Architecture Definition Document including Version 0.1 of baseline and target business/ data/ application/ technology architectures (8 documents in all)</li><li>Communication Plan</li><li>Content for the Architecture Repository </li><li>Other artifacts like Stakeholder Map Matrix, Business Model Diagram, Business Capability Map, Value Stream Map, Value Chain Diagram, Solution Concept Diagram</li></ul><p>Essentially, Preliminary Phase takes a dreamy view of what should be done. Architecture Vision gives a concrete vision about this ADM cycle.</p><h2>Creating the Vision</h2><hr/><p>Phase A starts with receipt of a Request for Architecture Work from the sponsoring organization to the architecture organization. The architecture vision helps the sponsor sell the proposed capability to the stakeholders. Architecture View includes an understanding of the emerging  technologies and their potential for the industry and this enterprise.</p><p>Architecture Vision phase ensures clarification and agreement on the purpose of the architecture effort. This is one of the key parts of this activity. </p><p>In addition to this, the Architecture Vision phase explores other domains which are appropriate for the Enterprise Architecture in hand. For example: Security, Information Management, Knowledge Management, and any other industry specific aspects.</p><p>At the end of the Architecture Vision phase, we have a complete signed Statement of Architecture Work</p></div><script src="vendor/jquery/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="vendor/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><script src="vendor/highlight/highlight.pack.js"></script><script src="scripts/blog.js"></script></body></html>

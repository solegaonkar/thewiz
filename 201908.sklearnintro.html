        <h1>The Sklearn library</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>The SciKitLearn library has a chunk of ready implementations of most basic Machine Learning algorithms. Most of the Machine Learning libraries are based on the principle of "concept-heavy
            and code-lite'. Once we understand the concepts well, the syntax of implementation is quite simple. ScikitLearn offers ready configurable classes for most of the algorithms. We just
            instantiate and then "fit" the model to the training data and then verify with the test data. All this can be achieved in just a couple of lines of code.</p>
        <p>Scikit-learn was initially developed by David Cournapeau as a Google summer of code project in 2007. Later Matthieu Brucher joined the project and started to use it as apart of his thesis
            work. In 2010 INRIA got involved and the first public release (v0.1 beta) was published in late January 2010. It is licensed under a permissive simplified BSD license and is distributed
            under many Linux distributions, encouraging academic and commercial use.</p>
        <p>SkLearn provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface in Python. We just need to instantiate the appropriate model, with the appropriate
            configuration (mapping the hyper-parameters). The library takes care of producing an efficient implementation for training and using the trained model. This allows us to focus on the core
            aspects of the machine learning, rather than the routine implementation of the standard algorithms.</p>
        <p>The library is built upon the SciPy (Scientific Python) that must be installed before you can use scikit-learn. This stack that includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>NumPy: Base n-dimensional array package</li>
            <li> SciPy: Fundamental library for scientific computing</li>
            <li> Matplotlib: Comprehensive 2D/3D plotting</li>
            <li> IPython: Enhanced interactive console</li>
            <li> Sympy: Symbolic mathematics</li>
            <li> Pandas: Data structures and analysis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Extensions or modules for SciPy care conventionally named SciKits. As such, the module provides learning algorithms and is named scikit-learn. The vision for the library is a level of
            robustness and support required for use in production systems. This means a deep focus on concerns such as easy of use, code quality, collaboration, documentation and performance. Although
            the interface is Python, c-libraries are leverage for performance such as numpy for arrays and matrix operations, LAPACK, LibSVM and the careful use of cython</p>

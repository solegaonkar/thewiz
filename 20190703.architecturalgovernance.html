        <h1>Architecture Governance</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>The ADM (or its adapted version) is an important document generated and managed in the ADM - like the other
            architecture artefacts managed in the Enterprise Continuum. The ADM (or its adapted version) itself is a
            major document in the Architecture Repository. It has to be reviewed by the Architecture Board, in order to
            ensure that it complies with the principles of ADM.</p>
        <p>Apart from this, the Architecture Governance should include the following information details:</p>
        <h4>Reference Data</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>The governance process should be based on internal or external reference. The reference data could be
            collated from within the organization's own repositories / enterprise continuum; or it could be based on
            external frameworks like COBIT, or IT4IT. </p>
        <p>This is used for guidance and instruction during project implementation. This includes the details of
            information outlined above. The reference data should include a description of the governance procedures.</p>
        <h4>Process Status</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>This defines the status of each step of the process that is followed in the ADM. All information regarding
            the state of any governance processes will be managed here. </p>
        <p>For example, it should include outstanding compliance requests, dispensation requests, and compliance
            assessments investigations.</p>
        <h4>Audit Information</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>This records all completed governance process actions. This information should be used to support various
            key decisions, and responsible personnel, while they work on any architecture project that has been
            sanctioned by the governance process. It is also a reference for future architectural and supporting
            process developments, guidance, and precedence. The governance artifacts and process are themselves part of
            the contents of the Architecture Repository.</p>
        <p>Essentially, the above three define the details of what needs to be done, how much is done, and how it is
            done.</p>

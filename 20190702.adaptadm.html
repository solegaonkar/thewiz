        <h1>Adapting the ADM</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>ADM provides a generic method for architecture development. But it is not a "one size - fit all" kind of a
            framework. It provides tools and guidelines that can be adapted and used for any enterprise architecture
            development. It is important to adapt the ADM for specific enterprise needs of the enterprise, to make it
            more effective.</p>
        <p>Hence, the major task before we applying the ADM is to review and choose the components for their relevance
            and utility for "this enterprise". Thus, adapting the ADM can produce an adapted version of the ADM -
            specific to the enterprise.</p>
        <p>There are several aspects that one can consider in this activity.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The current state of the enterprise</li>
            <li>The stakeholder's opinion about having an enterprise-wide architecture</li>
            <li>Business principles of the enterprise</li>
            <li>If the TOGAF is used alone or integrated with another framework</li>
            <li>The lifecycle and deliverables specified by the domain/industry </li>
            <li>One needs to interoperate with another enterprise that does not follow TOGAF</li>
            <li>The enterprise is relatively small and does not need the entire ADM</li>
            <li>The enterprise is too huge and complex; made of several independent yet interlinked enterprises. </li>
            <li>If the enterprise has an IT that is aligned to another product line architecture</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the business stakeholders do not yet acknowledge the need for an enterprise architecture, then the first
            two steps of creating an Architecture Vision should be followed by a detailed Business Architecture in
            order to underpin the Architecture Vision, detail the business case for remaining architecture work, and
            secure the active participation of key stakeholders in that work. </p>
        <p>In other cases a slightly different order may be preferred; for example, a detailed inventory of the
            baseline environment may be done before undertaking the Business Architecture.</p>
        <p>If the business principles dictate that the enterprise be prepared to adjust its business processes to meet
            the needs of a packaged solution (example AWS), so that it can be implemented quickly to enable fast
            response to market changes. In such a case, the completion of Business Architecture may have to wait for
            the completion of Information Systems Architecture or the Technology Architecture.</p>
        <p>If the ADM has to be used in conjunction with a generic framework like Zachman or an industry specific
            framework like TMF, we need to adapt the ADM to take care of the additional deliverables and steps dictated
            by these frameworks or industry standards. That could mean including additional steps and deliverables at
            specific points in the ADM cycle.</p>
        <p>ADM is complementary to, and supportive of, other standard program management processes, such as those for
            authorization, risk management, business planning and budgeting, development planning, systems development,
            and procurement. Thus, interoperability with other frameworks and industry standards is rarely a concern.
            But adapting the ADM to that extent is a necessary step.</p>
        <p>When working in a huge enterprise, made of several different collaborative enterprises, the overall
            framework and architecture methods need to be adapted to enable harmony. In such enterprises, different
            approaches (or their combinations) for planning and integration can be used to establish an overall
            enterprise framework.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Top-down planning and development - Here, we design the whole interconnected mega-enterprise as a
                single entity. Often this may not be so easy.</li>
            <li>We start by developing a "generic" or "reference" architecture - of a "typical enterprise" within the
                organization, but not representing any specific enterprise. With this reference architecture in place,
                individual enterprises can then expected adapt to produce an architecture "instance" suited to the
                particular enterprise concerned.</li>
            <li>Or we can develop a specific architecture for one enterprise. We can implement it as a
                proof-of-concept, and then taking that as a "reference architecture" to be cloned in other enterprises.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Neither approach is perfect or correct or incorrect. Each has its own approach to the problem, and we need
            to use a meaningful combination to apply it to real life.</p>
        <p>The first approach may seem childish. But it is often useful to an extent. Though we cannot club the entire
            mega-enterprise into one, it is often feasible to reduce the number of sub-enterprises following this
            approach.</p>
        <p>The second and the third appear similar, but there is a difference. The second approach admits that ideals
            are restricted to paper; and hence keeps the reference limited to documents; allowing each individual
            enterprise to adapt it in the appropriate way. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, the third approach believes that an ideal is meaningless unless it is proved in action.
            Hence, they start with proving the concept in one real enterprise; then allowing other enterprises to clone
            and adapt where required.</p>

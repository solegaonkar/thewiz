        <h1>The TOGAF Preliminary Phase</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>Things begin with a business directive for an enterprise architecture. That is when the preliminary phase
            begins. Here, we take care of preparation and initiation related activities. Unlike the rest of the ADM
            (that is iterative), the preliminary phase is executed only once. In essence, this phase takes care of
            identifying the desired Architecture Capability and the defining it in precise technical sense.</p>
        <p>In the Preliminary Phase, we define the "where, what, why, who, and how we do architecture" in the
            enterprise concerned. The main aspects are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Defining the enterprise</li>
            <li>Identifying key drivers and elements in the organizational context</li>
            <li>Defining the requirements for architecture work</li>
            <li>Defining the Architecture Principles that will inform any architecture work</li>
            <li>Defining the framework to be used</li>
            <li>Defining the relationships between management frameworks</li>
            <li>Evaluating the Enterprise Architecture maturity</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Inputs</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>The preliminary phase takes several inputs in form of the standards along with architectural and non
            architectural inputs. The foremost input is the TOGAF Library - that provides detailed account of proven
            techniques and tools for the process. Any other framework specific to the industry or the desired
            enterprise is also an input to this phase.</p>
        <p>This phase is not purely technical as it involves understanding and adopting plans, strategies, goals for
            the Business and the IT organization. It takes inputs from several project and portfolio management
            frameworks in play. It also needs inputs from the legal and contractual aspects of the business. </p>
        <p>Having digested these inputs, it can look into the architectural inputs like the current organizational
            enterprise. It takes inputs from any existing evaluation of the various aspects like scope, maturity
            assessment, role of architecture teams, the budget requirements and any governance/support strategies
            defined. It also takes inputs from the architecture framework currently in place - the principles, method,
            content and architecture repository along with the details of tools that are configured and deployed.</p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>The most important step in the preliminary phase is to initiate and adapt the ADM to define an organization
            specific framework. The level of detail for the preliminary phase depends on the scope and goals of the
            overall effort. Similarly, the order of the steps or the time spent on each depends upon various
            situational factors - within the limits defined by the architectural governance.</p>
        <h4>Define the Scope</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>This involves identifying 5 distinct entities</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Core Enterprise - The units that are most affected and achieve most benefit from the work</li>
            <li>Soft Enterprise - Units that will see some change to their capability - because they interact with the
                core enterprise. But they will not be directly affected</li>
            <li>Extended Enterprise - Units that are outside the scoped enterprise, yet will be affected by the work.</li>
            <li>Communities Involved - Stakeholders of enterprises that will be involved. </li>
            <li>Governance - Any necessary requirements including legal frameworks or geographies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Governance &amp; Support</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>The nature of Architecture Governance depends a lot on the architectural framework in use. The governance
            could be centralized or federated, light or heavy. The Architecture Governance organization and guidelines
            are developed in accordance with the Architecture Framework in play. This framework for Architectural
            Governance forms one of the important outputs of the preliminary phase.</p>
        <p>The different types of architectural material - standards, guidelines, models, compliance reports, etc.
            should be brought under governance. We need to define the repository characteristics in terms of the
            relationships and status recording of the artifacts - the definition of governance processes (dispensation,
            compliance, take-on, retirement, etc.) that own a given architectural artifact.</p>
        <p>Based on this, we evaluate if and how the existing governance and support models would change. The sponsors
            and stakeholders should be consulted. At the end of this step, the impacts of the new architectural
            framework need to be understood and agreed by the relevant stakeholders.</p>
        <h4>Enterprise Architecture Team and Organization</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>We start with evaluating and assessing the existing and target EA/Business capability and maturity along
            with the gaps between the two. This is followed by assigning roles and responsibilities for the capability
            management and governance.</p>
        <p>Based on the gap analysis, define the Request for Change to the existing business programs and projects.
            Consult the individual Enterprise and IT Architects, to assess the impact on their plans and work. After
            identifying and working on the common interests and conflicts, produce requests for change to the
            stakeholder activities. With these inputs, identify the constraints on the EA work to review and agree with
            the stakeholders. </p>
        <p>Finally, assess the budget requirements.</p>
        <h4>Architectural Principles</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>Architecture Principles are based on business principles and are critical in setting the foundation for
            Architecture Governance. Once the organizational context is understood, we must define a set of
            Architecture Principles that is appropriate to the enterprise.</p>
        <h4>Tailoring the Frameworks</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>The TOGAF and any other Framework in play should now be tailored to match each other and the enterprise
            needs. Tailoring the framework involves tailoring the Terminology, Process and Content of the framework.
        </p>
        <p>Tailoring should produce an agreed terminology that describes the various architectural components across
            the organization. There may be duplication or gaps in the processes over the organization and the different
            frameworks put together. These need to be addressed to define a consistent set of processes followed across
            the organization. Similarly, the content framework needs to be consistently updated to meet an organization
            wide enterprise continuum of architectural content.</p>
        <h4>Strategy for Tools &amp; Techniques</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>The tools strategy includes various aspects like management techniques, decision management, workshop
            techniques, business modeling, detailed infrastructure modeling, office products, languages, and repository
            management as well as more formal architecture tools. For example, the Balanced Scorecard technique is a
            best practice performance measurement tool used by business schools and many organizations that can be used
            successfully in architecture projects.</p>
        <p>A tools strategy enables more effective and rapid decision-making by stakeholders and their ownership of
            artifacts. Architecture content will be highly dependent on the scale, sophistication, and culture of both
            the stakeholders and the Architecture Capability within the organization.</p>
        <h2>Outputs</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>As we follow the above steps with the defined inputs, we should be able to generate the following outputs.
            The phase could have many more outputs; or lesser - as per the adaptation of the model. But this is the
            nominal set:</p>
        <h4>Organizational Model</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>The first output of the preliminary phase is an organizational model for the enterprise architecture. It
            should include</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The scope of the impacts, maturity assessment, the gaps identified</li>
            <li>The architecture team and their roles and responsibilities</li>
            <li>Constraints and budget requirements</li>
            <li>Governance &amp; support strategy</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Essentially, all the organizational aspects of the architecture initiation.</p>
        <h4>Tailored Architecture Framework</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>As we tailor the TOGAF and any additional framework in place, we generate an adapted framework that needs to
            be documented. This should document the tailored architecture methods, content and principles along with
            the configured and deployed tools.</p>
        <h4>Initial Architecture Repository</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>This documents the initial or baseline enterprise architecture framework in place (framework, not the actual
            architecture). Along with this, we document the contents of the initial architecture repository. It also
            includes the framework and its content.</p>
        <h4>Principles, Goals &amp; Drivers</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>We evaluate the business principles, goals and drivers; and the enterprise architecture in the light of
            these. Now, we need to document these more formally; or reference to another formal statement of these.</p>
        <h4>Request for Work</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>The Request for Architecture Work or the statement of work is generated in the preliminary phase. This
            should be formally documented as one of the outputs of the Preliminary Phase.</p>
        <h4>Architecture Governance Framework</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>The governance strategy is already in place (documented above). We also need to define the actual governance
            framework in the Preliminary Phase itself.</p>
        <p>Depending on the scale of the enterprise and the level of budgetary commitment, we may have to sub-divide or
            partition architecture teams, processes, and deliverables. There are several approaches for doing this. The
            Preliminary Phase should be used to determine the desired approach to partitioning and to establish the
            groundwork for the selected approach to be put into practice.</p>
        <p>The Preliminary Phase may be revisited, from the Architecture Vision phase, in order to ensure that the
            organization's Architecture Capability is suitable to address a specific architecture problem.</p>
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>The approach to the Preliminary phase can be understood on the different levels:</p>
        <h4>Enterprise</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>Defining the enterprise scope is one of the main challenges of Enterprise Architecture</p>
        <p>The scope of the enterprise, determines stakeholders who will derive most benefit from the Capability. At
            this point, it is necessary to ensure clear support of the business management, and appoint a sponsor, who
            can ensure that the resultant activity has resources to proceed. </p>
        <p>The enterprise may span across many organizations and the sponsor has to ensure that all stakeholders are
            included in defining, establishing, and using the Architecture Capability.</p>
        <h4>Organization</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>In order to get a meaningful output of the preliminary phase, one must understand the organization as a
            whole.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The commercial model of the enterprise and the budgetary plans. If it does not exist, the preliminary
                phase should come up with one.</li>
            <li>The stakeholders and their needs, issues and concerns</li>
            <li>The inherent culture of the organization, including the business directives, imperatives, strategies,
                principles, goals and drivers. </li>
            <li>The current processes in place and the level of rigor. </li>
            <li>The baseline architecture landscape of the enterprise, including the level of the documentation.</li>
            <li>Skills and capabilities of the of the enterprise and specific organizations that would be adapting the
                change.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These provide valuable inputs to defining and documenting the tailored architecture frameworks.</p>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>The requirements and performance metrics in play are defined by the business imperatives. The requirements
            should be clear enough so that we can appropriately scope the business outcomes and resource requirements.
            They should be clear enough, so that this phase can define an outline of the business information
            requirements for the enterprise, along with the associated strategies of the Enterprise Architecture work
            to be done.</p>
        <p>The requirements of the architecture work include the Business Architecture, Cultural Aspirations,
            Organization Intents, Strategic Intent, Forecast Financial Requirements. These need to be clearly
            articulated. Based on these, the sponsor can identify the various stakeholders. These stakeholders can be
            involved in defining and establishing the architecture capability</p>
        <h4>Architecture Principles</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>The Preliminary Phase defines the Architecture Principles that will form part of the constraints on any
            architecture work undertaken in the enterprise. The architecture principles are strongly influenced by the
            business principles and both together ensure the enterprise architecture effort is on track.</p>
        <h4>Management Frameworks</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>The enterprise may use TOGAF with or without other Architecture frameworks. TOGAF is designed to support and
            enhance other architecture frameworks that may coexist in the enterprise. </p>
        <p>Along with these, the enterprise may have other management frameworks for people/ process/ material/
            technology - to deliver a business capability. These frameworks coordinate with the TOGAF framework. The
            important among these frameworks are :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Business Capability Management:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Along with the architecture, more business capabilities are required to deliver a business value - including
            the definition of return on investment and the requisite control/ performance measures.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Project/ Portfolio Management Methods</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These methods define how the company manages the change initiatives that go through the enterprise.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operations Management Methods</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Apart from the changes and upgrades, it is important to ensure regular operation of what we already have.
            Tho Operation Management Methods determine how the company manages its day-to-day operations including IT.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Solution Development Methods</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An architecture is incomplete until it is converted into a solution that is deployed in the live enterprise.
            These methods formalize the way that business systems are delivered in accordance with the structures
            developed in the IT architecture.</p>
        <img class="image" src="img/togafmgmtframeworks1.png"/>
        <p>These frameworks are not discrete and there are significant overlaps between them and the Business
            Capability Management. The latter includes the delivery of performance measured business value. The point
            here is that the Enterprise Architecture should not narrow his focus to the IT aspects, but must be aware
            of the impact that the architecture has on the entire enterprise.</p>
        <p>The Enterprise Architecture provides a structure for all of the corporate initiatives. Portfolio Management
            Framework delivers the components of the architecture. The Operations Management Framework supports
            incorporation of these new components within the corporate infrastructure. The solution development
            methodology is used within the Portfolio Management Framework to plan, create, and deliver the
            architectural components specified in the project and portfolio charters.</p>
        <p>Thus, the management frameworks complement each other.</p>
        <img class="image" src="img/togafmgmtframeworks2.png"/>
        <h4>Maturity Evaluation</h4>
        <hr />
        <p>Maturity Models are useful in evaluating the ability of an enterprise. Organizations can develop their own
            maturity models or use one of the industry standards. But it is highly recommended to use an existing model
            and tailor it if required. Several good models exist, including NASCIO, and the US Department of Commerce
            Architecture Capability Maturity Model.</p>

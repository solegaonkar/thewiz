<p>Things begin with a business directive for an enterprise architecture. That is when the preliminary phase begins. Here, we take care of preparation and initiation related activities. Unlike the rest of the ADM (that is iterative), the preliminary phase is executed only once. In essence, this phase takes care of identifying the desired Architecture Capability and the defining it in precise technical sense.</p><h2>Inputs</h2><hr/><p>The preliminary phase takes several inputs in form of the standards along with architectural and non architectural inputs. The foremost input is the TOGAF Library - that provides detailed account of proven techniques and tools for the process. Any other framework specific to the industry or the desired enterprise is also an input to this phase.</p><p>This phase is not purely technical as it involves understanding and adopting plans, strategies, goals for the Business and the IT organization. It takes inputs from several project and portfolio management frameworks in play. It also needs inputs from the legal and contractual aspects of the business. </p><p>Having digested these inputs, it can look into the architectural inputs like the current organizational enterprise. It takes inputs from any existing evaluation of the various aspects like scope, maturity assessment, role of architecture teams, the budget requirements and any governance/support strategies defined. It also takes inputs from the architecture framework currently in place - the principles, method, content and architecture repository along with the details of tools that are configured and deployed.</p><h2>Steps</h2><hr/><p>The most important step in the preliminary phase is to initiate and adapt the ADM to define an organization specific framework. The level of detail for the preliminary phase depends on the scope and goals of the overall effort. Similarly, the order of the steps or the time spent on each depends upon various situational factors - within the limits defined by the architectural governance.</p><h4>Scope the impacted enterprise organizations</h4><hr/><p>This involves identifying 5 distinct entities</p><ul><li>Core Enterprise - The units that are most affected and achieve most benefit from the work</li><li>Soft Enterprise - Units that will see some change to their capability - because they interact with the core enterprise. But they will not be directly affected</li><li>Extended Enterprise - Units that are outside the scoped enterprise, yet will be affected by the work.</li><li>Communities Involved - Stakeholders of enterprises that will be involved. </li><li>Governance - Any necessary requirements including legal frameworks or geographies.</li></ul><h4>Confirm Governance &amp; Support Framework</h4><hr/>
